  % TODO: interest in fluid dynamics (turbulence, gas dynamics, combustion, (thermodynamics)), numerical analysis, -> cfd (finite volume, discontinuous Galerkin (CutFEM), high-order methods, pseudospectral methods?), high-performance computing

  I have experience in implementing [matrix-free CutFEM] finite-element methods in deal.ii.

  I am especially interested by bringing my skills together in the development of advanced high-order schemes for fluid dynamics.

  - solving adavanced physics porblems
