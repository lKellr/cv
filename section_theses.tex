  {A High-Order Matrix-Free CutFEM Approach for Parabolic Two-Phase Problems with\hfill\\ Moving Interfaces}{2024--2025}
  {Master's Thesis, Advisors: Maximilian Bergbauer, MSc and Andreas Koch, MSc}
  {Development of a matrix-free CutFEM scheme for the two-phase heat equation, with special focus on the interface movement at high polynomial order. Implemented in the deal.II-based framework \emph{Cut}.}

  {Investigation of Reacting Shock-Bubble Interactions in JAX-Fluids}{2022}
  {Term Paper, Advisor: Deniz A.\ Bezgin, MSc}
  {Establishment of the reactive flow module (multiple components, diffusive fluxes, transport and thermodynamic properties, chemical kinetics solver) for the differentiable finite volume code \emph{JAX-Fluids}. Evaluation in the reactive shock-bubble interaction case.}
  % On the flow side, this comprised diffusive fluxes and temperature laws for the transport properties (+thermodynamic properties). The reactive source term was parsed from mechanism files, integrated and incorporated via a splitting method.
  % reactive flow submodule (diffusive fluxes, temperature laws, reactive source term)
  % This entailed the development of a chemical kinetics solver.
  % Graded 1.0
  % {FV, Python, JAX, JAX-Fluids, git}
